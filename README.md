# ninedigitproblem

Find a number consisting of 9 digits in which each of the digits from 1 to 9 appears only once. This number must also satisfy these divisibility requirements:

- The number should be divisible by 9.

- If the rightmost digit is removed, the remaining number should be divisible by 8.

- If the rightmost digit of the new number is removed, the remaining number should be divisible by 7.

- And so on, until there's only one digit (which will necessarily be divisible by 1).
